### About Me

_Pronouns (he/him/his)_

> Marine Biology BS | University of California, Los Angeles

I am the lab & data manager for the Hampton Lab at Carnegie Science. Our work mainly focuses on the ecology & carbon cycles of lakes under ice and winter conditions, as well as rotifer ecology and egg development! In the past, I have researched Polynesian coral reefs, mammalian zoonotic pathology in Los Angeles, California Central Valley salmon ecology, and Scottish fisheries ecology. I love creating data management flows & protocols, analyzing & visualizing data, and making the occasional website or two.
