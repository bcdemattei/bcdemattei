I am the lab & data manager for the Hampton Lab at Carnegie Science. Our work mainly focuses on the ecology & carbon cycles of lakes under ice and winter conditions, as well as rotifer ecology and egg development! In the past, I have researched mammalian zoonotic pathology in Los Angeles, Polynesian coral reefs, California Central Valley salmon population ecology, and Scottish marine mixed fisheries ecology. I love creating data management flows & protocols, analyzing & visualizing data, and making the occasional website or two.
