My collection of really nice sheets of paper 👨‍🎓:

I am the lab & data manager for the Hampton Lab at the Carnegie Institution for Science based out of Caltech. Our work mainly focuses on the ecology of lakes under ice and winter conditions, as well as rotifer ecology and egg development! I'm a big fan of microscopy, data analysis, and making cool maps & graphs 📊 I also like to make websites!

Scientifically, I'm interetested in marine & freshwater fisheries, cetacean behavior, scientific communication & education, and pretty much anything to do with the ocean 🌊🐟🐋
